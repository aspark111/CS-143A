# CS-143A

//UCI CS 143A Schedulers Project 
//written in Java

//All the code that I needed to write for this project were the four files named after the different scheduling algorithms
//FCFS, SJF, Priority, RoundRobin

//I encourage prospecting students to PLEASE try to do these on your own
//A cheating programmer is a failing programmer
